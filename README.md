  /utils             #  date.js - function which accepts raw date and uses moment.js methods to format date and return the formatted date
                       request.js - function which accepts method, url, data, options properties and modifies the options object and fetches the database by using fetch() method and finally performs validation                          on the response object and conditionally returns it.
  
  /resources
    /images          # define a function which returns an object containing a list of different device categories. Each category has url property pointing to an image URL related to this category.
